    <H1>About me</H1>
    <p>I am an amateur self-taught web developer, I was raised in Mexico city but my life
        experience has taken me over a lot of different places and people, I love Louisiana
        people and their food is amazing, I have a lot of hobbies like videogames, music,
        writing and currently learning how to become a programmer by using different languages
        and also how to use that to animate cartoons or 3D objects.
        <br>
        My name you can say is kinda secret but must of my friends and colleagues call me 
        Charly Van Shy, I used to be Charly Zeke but that is now in the past LOL.
        <br>
        I am now interested in a lot of things and my future is bright since I like
        a lot the technologies that are constantly evolving day by day (One of these days
        I want to have a bio-cyborg body, who knows)
        <br>
        I am highly interested in themes like Cyber-punk or Psy-fi thematic related stuff,
        also I like phylosophy and consider my self an anarchist in the world, a concious 
        one, I hope this website can give you an idea of the kind of individual I am.
        <br>
        Aways looking for answers and fun.
