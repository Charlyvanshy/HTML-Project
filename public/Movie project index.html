 <h1>The best movies by Carlos</h1>
 <h2>Top 3 movies based on my opinion</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Leon the professional</h3>
 <p>By far the best movie in the world.
 Great actors cast, inluding Jean Reno, Natalie Portman,
    Danny Aiello, Gary Oldman, among others,
    an amazing arc on the story and a twist out of nowhere
    ending.
 </p>
 <h3>Terminator 2</h3>
 <p>By far the best movie of the Terminator franchise
    great actors on screen and the themes this movie touches can go 
    from psi-fy to     phylosophical themes such as what is human 
    nature or what define our humanity.
 </p>
 <h3>Rumble in the Bronx</h3>
 <p>One of the best movies ever made by Jackie Chan, it has everything
parting from a inmigrant arriving to america then to be a social justice
 hero based on the circumstances then to play on the bad guys side because
we are trying to build a better future for everyone, great movie, great message
and great actors, not a prize award movie but definetely enterteining.
